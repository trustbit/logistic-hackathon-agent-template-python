# The world map can be downloaded by a truck agent from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trustbit/logistic-hackathon-public/main/data/map.json during a simulation run.
# It is not required to download it, but a team might be able to get some useful  information from the map to optimize their truck agents decisions.
# To make individual decide requests as fast as possible, it is better to download the map at the very beginning, when the agent starts up,
# otherwise the simulation might decide that the truck is reacting too slow and exclude it from the current simulation run.
